This directory contains both macro- and micro-benchmarks for Python
implementations.

Macro(ish)benchmarks:
    - bm_django.py: assess Django template performance.
    - bm_pickle.py: test picking/unpickling performance.
    - bm_spitfire.py: assess Spitfire template performance.
    - gcbench.py: GC benchmark (allocate and deallocate lots of objects).
      Copied from PyPy's pypy/translator/goal/gcbench.py, r60845.


Microbenchmarks:
    - bm_ai.py: solvers for alphametics and N-Queens problems. These are
      classified as "micro" because they're dominated by a single function.
    - tuple_gc_hell.py: stress the GC by allocating lots of tuples.


Crap benchmarks used for historical comparisons:
    - pybench/: PyBench 2.0 benchmark suite.
    - pystone.py: standard PyStone benchmark.
    - richards.py: standard Richards benchmark.
      Copied from PyPy's pypy/translator/goal/richards.py, r60845.
